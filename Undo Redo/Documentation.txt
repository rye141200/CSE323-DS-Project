    1) Breif Description
    ---------------------
    
    The setCurrentFileContent(String currentFileContent) function takes a string as
    an argument which represents the current text or content in the file. When a change
    happens, before the currentFileContent string variable gets updated with the new
    content, we push the old content in the undoStack so we can go back to it if needed.

    If the undo() function was called, then we push the currentFileContent in the redoStack
    so if we needed we can get it, then we set the currentFileContent with the last string
    that was pushed in the undoStack, and finally we pop that string from the redoStack.

    If the redo() function was called, then we push the currentFileContent in the undoStack
    so if we needed we can get it, then we set the currentFileContent with the last string
    that was pushed in the redoStack, and finally we pop that string from the redoStack.
    
    
    2) Time Complexity
    -------------------
    
    Each function take (approx.) a time complexity of O(1) in the worst case.


    3) Space Complexity
    --------------------

    It is worth noting that while we did make the Undo/Redo functionality undo and
    redo every change that happens in a file, that comes at the cost of the memory 
    as every small change and the whole file is pushed to the stack.

    But the nature of the program that it was made to do some functionalities on the 
    inputted file, maybe some changes to it, but it's not mainly for just editing a file.

    We could make it to undo or redo a fixed number of changes to avoid any memory overflow
    problems due to maybe keep changing the file leading to pushing alot to the stack.
    But this could increase the time complexity in a vital functionality like that,
    so we would leave it as that, and warn the user to look out for any high memory usage
    in case of making alot of changes sequentially.
