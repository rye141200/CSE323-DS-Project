the idea of the detection and correction part is that we divide the detection into two parts 

------------------------------part1----------------------------------
that we detect errors in the same line whatever it's missing closing tag or missing opening tag or mismatch between closing tag and openining tag 

the detection methods return error message saying type of error missing tag or mismatch , also it gives number line contain error 

e.g 
<root>
  <gender>male          -----> message =  "MISSING OPENING TAG FOR <gender> IN LINE NUMBER 2"
  <name>mohamed<\id>    -----> message =  "MIAMATCH BETWEEN <name> AND <id> IN LINE NUMBER 3"
    1</id>          	-----> message =  "MISSING CLOSING TAG FOR <id> IN LINE NUMBER 4"	
<\root>														
			dataParsedByLine is arraylist of strings contain lines in XML file 		
			detectionTags(arraylist<string> dataParsedByLine): return arraylist of messages that says type of error and line number where error happens

then 

	correctionTags()---> function takes the messages and correct the error according to line number and type of error 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------part2----------------------------------
we detect error of missing closing tag but not in the same line 

the detection methods return error message saying type of error missing tag or mismatch , also it gives number line contain error 

e.g 
<root>
  <gender>male         
  <name>mohamed<\id>    
    1</id>          		
			-----> message =  "MISSING CLOSING TAG FOR <root> IN LINE NUMBER 5"
										
			dataParsedByLine is arraylist of strings contain lines in XML file 		
			detectionMissingClosingTag(arraylist<string> dataParsedByLine): return arraylist of messages that says type of error and line number where error happens
			the idea of this function that we push any opening Tag into the stack and if the closing tag matches the the top of the stack then pop from stack 
			if no closing tag is found 
			1)if element in this next line is opening tag so there is missing closing tag 
				and then push this closing tag in the stack 
			2) if element in this next line is closing tag and this tag is not closing for opening tag so there is missing closing tag 
					then pop all opening tags untill you found the opening tag for this closing tag this means that 
						all all the poped opening tag didn't have their closing tags  
then 

	correctionMissingClosingTag(String path,ArrayList<String> messages)---> function takes the messages and correct the error according to line number and type of error
	the idea in this method is putting closing tag from the given message into the given line and wit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  then collect all two types of detections into one arraylist contains all errors in file
