    1) Breif Description
    ---------------------
    
    The compressFile(String fileType) function takes a string as an argument which
    represents the the type of the file that will be compressed, and it's either 
    a "JSON" or "XML" file.
    
    The Algorithm used iterates over all the lines while rewriting each uniqe 
    tag as a single uniqe upper-case character and stores the tag and the corresponding 
    upper-case character, so we can go back to the original text using the decompressFile().
    
    The key idea is that instead of writing multiple characters to represent a single tag,
    we just write a unique single upper-case character, which decreases the size of
    the file leading to a file compression.
    
    The decompressFile() function simply does the opposite, knowing the unique character
    for each tag, we loop over each line and rewrite each unique character with its 
    corresponding tag that we stored earlier.
    
    
    2) Time Complexity
    -------------------
    
    Each function take (approx.) a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case.
    Assuming that (n) is the total number of characters in the whole file.
